# python-keylogger

This project is a simple GUI-based keylogger built with Python to demonstrate event-driven programming and keyboard monitoring concepts. It uses the pynput library to capture key press, hold, and release events in real time, and a basic tkinter window to start the logger.

Records all keyboard events and stores them in a list

Saves structured event data (Pressed, Held, Released) to logs.json

Maintains a plain-text keystroke timeline in logs.txt

Provides a minimal Tkinter interface with a “Start Keylogger” button
